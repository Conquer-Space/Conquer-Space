# bugprone-lambda-function-name is removed because it complains about spdlog in lambdas,
# which we don't really care about because spdlog reads the line and file anyway.
#
# modernize-avoid-c-arrays is removed because we use a lot of c style arrays for opengl
# and it's common practice to do that.
#
# clang-analyzer-optin.portability.UnixAPI, warns on stb_write_image, is vauge, and the documentation
# says nothing about what it does. It's opt in anyway, so we don't need it.
