### Libraries used
Here is a list of libraries used. Most of the time libraries are added with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), but when
they are not on vcpkg, or they need some customization, then they are added via git submodule.

<https://vcpkg.info> is a useful library to use to check if the library exists on vcpkg.
