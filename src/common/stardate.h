/// Holds and calculates the tick that is on going. Date is the number of hours that has been

/// should be done at.
/// 1 tick: Combat ticks, planetary and ship movement?
/// 25 ticks: (about a day) Economic activity, though I don't think it's such a good idea to
///     put them in such a tight interval.
/// 25 * 5 = 125 ticks: (about 5 days)
/// 25 * 25 = 625 ticks: (about 26 days) Construction progress, pop growth, social changes, will
///     also be the interval that would be used for the reference value
/// 25 ^ 3 / 2 ~= 15625 ticks: (about 312 days) Momentous things and things that take a long time,
///     such as planet's climates changing
/// We will not do days and years, because these are specific to only earth, and we would like to
/// portray the different cultural differences resulting from different orbital periods and
/// rotational periods from planets, and it would be rather human-centric to assume other
/// civilizations would use our calendar. As a result, I plan to introduce a system that allows
/// the creation of different types of calendars. That would come later, though
///
/// However, this can bring some issues with statistics, because it can be hard for the player
/// to know how much they are gaining over some year, especially as we calculate over the period
/// that is irregular with a year. We can do that by calculating the ratio between the interval
/// and the calendar time. Not sure how well that would work though.
